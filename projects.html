<h3>University of Manchester</h3>

<p> From 2023 to 2028 I will be working on the research project "Model theory, Diophantine geometry, and automorphic functions" supported by <a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FX009823%2F1">EPSRC Open Fellowship EP/X009823/1</a> 
  and Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw Fellowship (PI: Vahagn Aslanyan). The main aim of this project is to make progress on two major problems at the boundary between model theory, complex geometry, and number theory &ndash; the Existential Closedness and 
  Zilber-Pink conjectures for automorphic functions together with their derivatives &ndash; and explore the connections between them. I am looking for a postdoc (for 3 years) to work with me on this project, and will soon post a job opening.
In the meantime, you can get in touch with me if you are interested.</p>


<h4> PhD projects </h4>
	
 I am looking for PhD students to work with me on the Existential Closedness and/or Zilber-Pink problems or related topics. I have advertised a PhD project called 
		<a href="https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/projects/?utm_source=courseprofile&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fse_pgr_2324&utm_content=how_to_apply_project">
			<"The Existential Closedness problem for exponential and automorphic functions"</a>. I will advertise another project on Zilber-Pink soon. If you are interested in these or would like to work with me on a different topic 
				(e.g. differential algebra), please get in touch. 

	

<h3>University of Leeds</h3>

<p> From 2022 to 2023 I worked on the project "Model theory, Diophantine geometry, and modular functions" supported by the Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship ECF-2022-082 (PI: Vahagn Aslanyan). This is now incorporated into the above project.</p>

<h3>University of East Anglia</h3>

<p> From 2019 to 2022 I was a postdoc on the project "Exponentially Algebraically Closed Fields" supported by the <a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FS017313%2F1">EPSRC Standard Grant EP/S017313/1</a> (PI: Jonathan Kirby). The aim of this project was to 
  make progress on the Exopnential Algebraic Closedness conjecture.</p>
